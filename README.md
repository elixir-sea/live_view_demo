# TypoPaint

The Typo~Piant~Paint project is an attempt to develop a fun typing game in elixir using LiveView.

The goal of the project will be to enable focused opportunities for people in the Seattle area to collaborate on writing Elixir and LiveView code coming from different skill levels.

## Development Instructions

For development, you'll need Elixir, Erlang and Node.js. If you use the [asdf version manager](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) and install the [relevant plugins](https://asdf-vm.com/#/plugins-all?id=plugin-list), you can install the versions specified in `.tool-versions` with `asdf install`.

## Contributing

Anyone in the Seattle area can be a contributor. Ask in the #seattle or the #typo_kart channel in the [Elixir-Lang slack group](https://elixir-slackin.herokuapp.com/).

We are using a simple Pull Request model. Create a new branch based on master for you additions and then create a PR against master.

Pull requests require a code review from at least one other contributor, but then can be merged to master by anyone. The goal is to get new features into master as quickly as possible, so the reviewer should just merge once approved.
